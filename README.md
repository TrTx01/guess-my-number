> **Can a machine intercept your thoughts?** Experience the "glitch in the matrix" with this high-octane, Cyberpunk-themed digital magic trick.



## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Think of a number between **1 and 63**.
2. Answer 6 simple "Yes/No" questions.
3. Watch the AI scan your neural frequencies.
4. Prepare to be shocked when it reveals your exact number.

## 🧠 The "Magic" (The Science)
While it feels like psychic ability, this game is powered by the **Binary Number System**. 

The game presents 6 sets of numbers, each representing a "bit" in a 6-bit binary sequence:
* **Set 1:** $2^0$ (Value: 1)
* **Set 2:** $2^1$ (Value: 2)
* **Set 3:** $2^2$ (Value: 4)
* **Set 4:** $2^3$ (Value: 8)
* **Set 5:** $2^4$ (Value: 16)
* **Set 6:** $2^5$ (Value: 32)

By clicking "Yes," you are essentially telling the computer to "flip the bit" to 1. The computer then adds those specific values together to reconstruct your thought!
